<p>Study notes of React-Redux from DanAbramov's Talk</p>

<h2>
<a id="1-the-single-immutable-state-tree" class="anchor" href="#1-the-single-immutable-state-tree" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. The Single Immutable State Tree</h2>

<p>The first principle of Redux is, the entire application's state is managed through a Single JS Object i.e, <strong>'Single Immutable State Tree'</strong>.</p>

<p>Everything that changes within the application, including the data &amp; the UI State are contained in single JS Object called 'State Tree'.</p>

<p>In more complex applications, more state to keep track of. You can track back the state changes from this State tree.</p>

<a id="2-describing-state-changes-with-actions" class="anchor" href="#2-describing-state-changes-with-actions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Describing State changes with Actions</h2>

<p>The state-tree is read-only.</p>

<p>Whenever you want to change the state, you need to dispatch an action.</p>

<p>An action is a plain js object which defines the change.</p>

<p>Just like the State is the minimial representation of data in the app,
The Action is the minimal representation of the change to the data.</p>

<p>The structure of Action object is up to you, the only requirement is that it has a</p>

<p><code>type</code> property, which is not undefined.</p>

<p>Its suggested that to use "String" as it's serializable.</p>

<p>Different type of apps have Different type of actions. We don't need additional information for passing the action.</p>

<h2>
<a id="3-pure--impure-function" class="anchor" href="#3-pure--impure-function" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. Pure &amp; Impure Function</h2>

<p>Its important to understand the pure &amp; impure functions.</p>

<h3>
<a id="pure-functions" class="anchor" href="#pure-functions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pure Functions</h3>

<p>Pure Functions are the functions whose return values are solely dependent on the parameters passed on to the functions. Pure Functions doesn't have any observable side effects such as network/database calls.</p>

<p>You can be confident that if you call a pure function, for the  same arguments, your are gonna get the same return values always. Results are predictable.</p>

<pre><code>function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pure functions doesn't modify the values to passed to them. In the following example, the items array is not modified, instead it returns a new Array, by using items.map();</p>

<pre><code>function squareAll(items) {
  return items.map(square);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="impure-functions" class="anchor" href="#impure-functions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Impure Functions</h3>

<p>On the opposite,  Impure functions, they may have side effects;
they may call db, make network requests, they may override the values to passed to them.</p>

<pre><code>function square(x) {
  updateXinDB(x);
  return x * x;
}

function squareAll(items) {
  for(let i=0; i&lt;items.length; i++ ){
    items[i] = square(items[i]);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="4-the-reducer-function" class="anchor" href="#4-the-reducer-function" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4. The Reducer Function</h2>

<p>The UI/View layer is more predictable, when it is just described as pure functions of the application state. This approach was pioneered by React.</p>

<p>Redux complements this approach with another idea.</p>

<p>The state mutation in your app should be  described as pure function.</p>

<p>That takes <code>PreviousState</code> , <code>ActionBeingDispatched</code> and return the <code>NextState</code> of your application.</p>

<p>In any redux application, there is one particular function that takes the  state of the whole application and the action being dispatched and return the next state of the whole application.</p>

<p>It is important that it doesn't modify the state to given to it. It has to be pure and should only return the next state.(new object)</p>

<p>This function is called <strong>'Reducer'</strong> Function.</p>

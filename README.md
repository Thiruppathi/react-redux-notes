Study notes of React-Redux from DanAbramov's Talk

## 1. The Single Immutable State Tree

The first principle of Redux is, the entire application's state is managed through a Single JS Object i.e, *'Single Immutable State Tree'*.

Everything that changes within the application, including the data & the UI State are contained in single JS Object called 'State Tree'.

In more complex applications, more state to keep track of. You can track back the state changes from this State tree.


## 2. Describing State changes with Actions


## 3. Pure & Impure Function

## 4. The Reducer Function
